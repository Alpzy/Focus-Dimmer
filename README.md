# Focus Dimmer
This is the repository for a Visual Studio Extension which is inspired by **[limelight.vim](https://github.com/junegunn/limelight.vim)** by **[junegunn](https://github.com/junegunn)** :smile:

**VS Marketplace Link:** [Focus Dimmer at Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Alpzy.FocusDimmer)

## Description
When enabled, this extension sets the color of the code as dimgray except for the block that is currently being worked on. 
This might help to reduce eye stress and increase productivity while coding. 

- Please note that you might have performance issues since this project is developed on a learn-on-the-go lifecycle. (what?)
- The code quality might suck, but I'm open to contributions, advices and hi-tech knowledge that you might wanna share.

**Installation/Building guide**: [MSDN Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/extensibility/walkthrough-publishing-a-visual-studio-extension?view=vs-2019)

## Features
You can easily toggle it on or off by using the default keyboard shortcut (ALT+L) or click on the Toggle Focus Dimmer option under the tools menu.
